I'm looking for PhD students (home or international) in *learning theory* (statistical learning theory, deep learning theory, computational learning theory) or theoretical-oriented topics, e.g., *fine-tuning*. Besides, I'm also interested in principles and scalability of large language models. 
This position is full-funded and research-oriented.
Besides, applications from other sources of scholarship are also welcome, e.g., [https://warwick.ac.uk/services/dc/schols_fund/scholarships_and_funding/cis Chancellor's International Scholarship] for EU/International applicants as well as [https://warwick.ac.uk/services/dc/schols_fund/scholarships_and_funding/csc CSC] for Chinese applicants.

My research to theoretically understand why ML models perform well or design efficient (and/or) robust algorithms. Possible topics include (but are not limited to) 

- *Statistical-computational gap in modern machine learning:* It delves into a pivotal question within the machine learning community: how can we theoretically explain the empirical phenomena observed in over-parameterized models from the perspective of statistical and computational side? Our target is to bridge the gap between empirical observations and rigorous theoretical assurances, particularly in the context of neural networks.

- *Post-training of modern machine learning models:* It aims to theoretically understand the mystery of post-training and/or devise theory-grounded resource-efficient post-training methods for LLMs.

*{{<font color="red">Candidate's profile:</font>}}* The successful candidate is expected to have a solid background in applied mathematics, statistics, computer science or related discipline. Besides, applicants must also meet the University of Warwick minimum entry requirements for the MPhil/PhD course in Computer Science. Refer to [https://warwick.ac.uk/study/postgraduate/courses/compsciencephd official application process] for details, including

- A good bachelors degree (UK 2.1 level or above or international equivalent)
Proficiency in English (both oral and written). Good communication and technical writing skills.
Strong maths background (Linear Algebra and Probability knowledge is a plus).

- English Proficiency level of IELTS 6.5 overall, with all components at 6.0. (International applicants need ATAS clearance). 


The [https://warwick.ac.uk/services/dc/schols_fund/current/feelevels/ salary and benefits] are comparable to other top universities in the UK, and the cost of living near Warwick is significantly lower. 

*{{<font color="red">Application:</font>}}* Please send an email to me with *your CV* and *transcript* as well as *a brief description of your research interests* and *why you want to work with me*. Due to a large number of requests, I, unfortunately, may not be able to reply to all the emails regarding PhD applications. 
But if your enquires are inline with my research, I will contact you.


*{{<font color="red">About Warwick:</font>}}* The University of Warwick has one of the leading Computer Science departments in the UK (ranked 4th UK computer science department in the 2021 research excellence framework). The department, particularly well-known for its research in *theoretical computer science*, consistently produces top quality research and has strong links with research from the [https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/ Warwick Mathematics Institute]. It offers a unique environment for research on the mathematical aspects of computer science among the top theory groups in the UK.
