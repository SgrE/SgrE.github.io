= About me \n

I received my Bachelor’s degree in Automation from Harbin Institute of Technology in 2014 and my PhD degree from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) in 2019. I subsequently held postdoctoral research positions at KU Leuven and EPFL from 2019 to 2023. After that, I have held faculty positions (or affiliated) at the University of Warwick (Department of Computer Science and the Centre for Discrete Mathematics and its Applications, DIMAP), the Technical University of Munich (Global Visiting Professor), and Shanghai Jiao Tong University (Institute of Natural Sciences, School of Mathematical Sciences).

#== Notice



#Previously, I was a postdoc researcher at EPFL, Switzerland, hosted by [https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lions/people/volkan-cevher/ Prof. Volkan Cevher] from 2021 to 2023. Before that, I spent two years as a postdoc researcher at ESAT-STADIUS, KU Leuven, Belgium, hosted by [https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/sista/members/suykens.html Prof. Johan A.K. Suykens].

#I obtained the Ph.D degree from Institute of Image Processing Pattern Recognition in Department of Automation, Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) in June 2019, supervised by [http://www.pami.sjtu.edu.cn/En/jieyang Prof. Jie Yang], and the B.E. degree in Automation, Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT) in 2014.

#Here is my [files/CV_Fanghui.pdf CV].


#== Education
#- Ph.D. in Department of Automation (Pattern Recognition and Intelligent Systems), Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Sep. 2014 - Jun. 2019
#- B.S. in Department of Automation, Harbin Institute of Technology, Sep. 2010 - Jun. 2014

== Research Interests 
#- Statistical machine learning, kernel methods, learning theory
#- Computer Vision

I'm generally interested in *foundations of modern machine learning* from the lens of *learning efficiency*, both theoretically and empirically. My research is always contributing to how to *handle nonlinearity at a theoretical level* and how to precisely and efficiently *approximate nonlinearity at a practical level* under theoretical guidelines, which is a longstanding question over science, technology and engineering.

My research (the past, ongoing and future) focuses on the following directions:
- machine learning theory: what is the largest function space that can be learned by neural networks, both statistically and computationally efficiently (computational-statistical gaps)?
- post-training in LLMs:  expand the frontiers of empirical and theoretical knowledge on when and where to fine-tune/inference, and how much we can fine-tune/inference, precisely, efficiently, and robustly

My research is supported by grants from Royal Society (UK), Alan Turing Institute (UK), and DAAD (Germany).

We're organising [https://ijcvsi25pt.github.io/ *{{<font color="DarkMagenta"> IJCV Special Issue on Post-Training in Large Language Models for Computer Vision</font>}}*]!

== Jobs

*{{<font color="red">The position for 2026 Fall is fulfilled.</font>}}* See [https://www.lfhsgre.org/positions.html Open positions] for details.

As our department requires a research proposal as part of the PhD application, I strongly encourage interested candidates to contact me *in advance of the application deadline* (check [https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/research/cscdt/fundingadvice website] for details). If you are a strong fit based on my evaluation, I will spend some time to support you in preparing a competitive proposal and application.

Due to a large number of requests, I, unfortunately, may not be able to reply to all the emails regarding PhD applications. However, I'll look at applicants that have sent me emails and contact you soon if your enquires are indeed inline with my research.

#Warwick has a strong research direction on TCS, mathematics, and statistics. If you would like to work with me on machine learning theory or theoretical-oriented application topics, feel free to reach out by sending me an email with your CV and transcript. Besides, I will appreciate if you include a short description about your motivation and some highlights of your past experience or achievements.
