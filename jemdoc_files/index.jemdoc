== About me

I'm currently an assistant professor at [https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/ Department of Computer Science], a member of [https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/cross_fac/dimap/ Centre for Discrete Mathematics and its Applications (DIMAP)], an affliated member of [https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/research/focs/people/ the Division of Theory and Foundations (FoCS)], at the University of Warwick, UK.
Besides, I'm also a visiting research scientist at at [https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lions/people/guests/fanghui-liu-starts-1st-october/ EPFL], Switzerland. I am an [https://ellis.eu/members/ ELLIS Member].

Previously, I was a postdoc researcher in the Laboratory for Information and Inference Systems 
(LIONS), École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Switzerland, 
working with [https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lions/people/volkan-cevher/ Prof. Volkan Cevher] from 2021 to 2023. 
Before that, I spent two years as a postdoc researcher in Department of Electrical Engineering (ESAT-STADIUS), 
KU Leuven, Belgium, hosted by [https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/sista/members/suykens.html Prof. Johan A.K. Suykens].

I obtained the Ph.D degree from Institute of Image Processing Pattern Recognition in Department of Automation, Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) in 
June 2019, supervised by [http://www.pami.sjtu.edu.cn/En/jieyang Prof. Jie Yang], 
and the B.E. degree in Automation, Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT) in 2014.

#== Education
#- Ph.D. in Department of Automation (Pattern Recognition and Intelligent Systems), Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Sep. 2014 - Jun. 2019
#- B.S. in Department of Automation, Harbin Institute of Technology, Sep. 2010 - Jun. 2014

== Research Interests 
#- Statistical machine learning, kernel methods, learning theory
#- Computer Vision

I'm generally interested in *mathematical foundations of machine learning*, 
 e.g., *statistical learning theory* and deep learning theory on the generalization properties of under-/over-parameterized models.
Currently I'm also interested in reinforcement learning theory, especially on function approximation, from classical statistical learning to sequential decision making.

My research interest starts from kernel methods to large-scale computational methodologies in algorithm, and mainly focuses on theoretically understanding generalization properties of machine learning based algorithms, especially on *over-parameterized models* (motivated by neural networks).
In fact, my research line can be understood from a *function space theory* perspective, from RKHS to hyper-RKHS, Barron spaces, Besov spaces.
This aims to understand the role of over-parameterization from kernel methods to neural networks.

Besides, I also spend time on student projects in theoretical-oriented application topics,
e.g., robustness and verification \[[https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07263 NeurIPS22], [https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07235 NeurIPS22]\], neural architecture search \[[https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07238 NeurIPS22]\], and out-of-distribution generalization \[[https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07736 NeurIPS22]\], which aims to build *trustworthy machine learning* systems.
